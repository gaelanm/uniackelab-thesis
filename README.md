Computational analyses related to ISG15 in physiology and cancer.

ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that is co-translationally conjugated to hundreds of intracellular proteins. ISG15 biology is poorly understood despite extensive lines of investigation implicating ISG15 in tumor biology and progression.

We therefore coupled GOEA visualizations with Genewalk interpretation of the ISGylome to conceptualize the system-level activity of protein ISGylation.
